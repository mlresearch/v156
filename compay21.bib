                  breast cancer is one of the key steps in determining
                  the prognosis and treatment strategy. The standard
                  clinical practice is to do this analysis based on
                  multiple immunohistochemistry (IHC) stainings for
                  each biomarker, which is expensive and inconsistent
                  when lacking resources. In this work, we
                  investigated the predictiveness of morphological
                  characteristics of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)
                  stained tissues for molecular subtype analysis, as
                  an initial step for direct treatment response
                  prediction based on H\&E whole slide images
                  (WSI). Transfer learning using backbones pre-trained
                  on natural images is a common practice to deal with
                  the challenge of lack of large and precisely
                  annotated datasets. However, using pre-training on
                  natural images is not optimal for clinical images.
                  To deal with this challenge and leverage large pools
                  of unlabeled data, we propose to use a specialized
                  backbone pre-trained on H\&E WSI in a
                  self-supervised setting, i.e.~without any
                  labels. Our experiments show that this backbone is
                  capable of learning discriminating morphological
                  characteristics from H\&E images which are well
                  predictive of the molecular subtypes in weakly
                  supervised settings. Also, the network performs
                  better in terms of generalization to unseen data
                  from new scanner types, despite the relatively small
                  size of the dataset used for pre-training the
                  backbone.  }

                  to derive clinically relevant
                  information. Digitization and storage of whole slide
                  images have become commonplace and allow modern
                  image analysis methods to be used. In recent years,
                  computer-based segmentation of cell nuclei has
                  gathered considerable attention in the development
                  of highly specialized algorithms. Currently, most of
                  these algorithms are based on performing semantic
                  segmentation of all cell nuclei and separating
                  overlapping instances in a post-processing
                  step. Recently, instance-aware segmentation methods
                  such as Mask R-CNN have been proposed to enable
                  unified instance detection and segmentation, even in
                  overlapping cases. In this work, we propose a
                  modified Mask R-CNN-based approach by incorporating
                  distance maps of instances and hematoxylin-stain
                  intensities as extra input channels to the
                  model. Moreover, we explore the impact of three
                  well-known inference strategies, namely test-time
                  augmentation, ensembling, and knowledge transfer
                  through pre-training on the segmentation
                  performance. We perform extensive ablation
                  experiments across multiple runs to quantitatively
                  define the most optimal inference strategy in the
                  proposed Mask R-CNN algorithm. Our results show that
                  average instance segmentation improvements of up to
                  3.5\% and 4.1\% based on Aggregate Jaccard Index and
                  Panoptic Quality score can be obtained,
                  respectively, using the proposed techniques in
                  comparison to a standard Mask R-CNN model. Our
                  findings confirm the effectiveness of aggregating
                  information at the network input stage and
                  optimizing inference workflows using minimal

                  imaging technique that produces the high sensitivity
                  and specificity of single-cell mapping. With a tenet
                  of ``seeing is believing'', MxIF enables iterative
                  staining and imaging extensive antibodies, which
                  provides comprehensive biomarkers to segment and
                  group different cells on a single tissue
                  section. However, considerable depletion of the
                  scarce tissue is inevitable from extensive rounds of
                  staining and bleaching (``missing
                  tissue''). Moreover, the immunofluorescence (IF)
                  imaging can globally fail for particular rounds
                  (``missing stain''). In this work, we focus on the
                  ``missing stain'' issue. It would be appealing to
                  develop digital image synthesis approaches to
                  restore missing stain images without losing more
                  tissue physically. Herein, we aim to develop image
                  synthesis approaches for eleven MxIF structural
                  molecular markers (i.e., epithelial and stromal) on
                  real samples. We propose a novel multi-channel
                  high-resolution image synthesis approach, called
                  pixN2N-HD, to tackle possible missing stain
                  scenarios via a high-resolution generative
                  adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution is
                  three-fold: (1) a single deep network framework is
                  proposed to tackle missing stain in MxIF; (2) the
                  proposed ``N-to-N'' strategy reduces theoretical
                  four years of computational time to 20 hours when
                  covering all possible missing stains scenarios, with
                  up to five missing stains (e.g., ``(N-1)-to-1'',
                  ``(N-2)-to-2''); and (3) this work is the first
                  comprehensive experimental study of investigating
                  cross-stain synthesis in MxIF. Our results elucidate
                  a promising direction of advancing MxIF imaging with
                  deep image synthesis. }

                  marrow. There are various ways to diagnose multiple

                  explored. To this end, a two- stage deep learning
                  method is designed. In the first stage, the nucleus
                  detection network is utilized to extract each
                  instance of a cell of interest. The extracted
                  instance is then fed to the multi-scale function to
                  generate a multi-scale representation. The objective
                  of the multi-scale function is to capture the shape
                  variation and reduce the effect of object scale on
                  the cytoplasm segmentation network. The generated

                  network, we included a scale aggregation function to

                  computational assessment of the cytopathological
                  status of a sample raises the challenge of
                  identifying few cancerous cells among thousands of
                  cells in a microscopic whole-slide image. To address
                  this challenge, we propose an end-to-end trainable
                  multiple instance learning approach that combines
                  the attention mechanism and hard negative mining to
                  classify hematoxylin and eosin stained patient-level

                  singular cells are extracted by a simple foreground
                  detection algorithm. With feature embeddings
                  computed for each image patch in a bag by a
                  convolutional neural network, the attention

                  potential regions of interest that trigger a
                  patient-level decision. Our results show that the

                  in adults. To determine its malignancy, it is graded
                  by a pathologist into three grades according to WHO
                  standards. This grade plays a decisive role in
                  treatment, and yet may be subject to inter-rater
                  discordance. In this work, we present and compare
                  three approaches towards fully automatic meningioma
                  grading from histology whole slide images. All
                  approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where
                  we first identify a region of interest based on the
                  detection of mitotic figures in the slide using a
                  state-of-the-art object detection deep learning
                  network. This region of highest mitotic rate is
                  considered characteristic for biological tumor
                  behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score
                  corresponding to tumor malignancy based on
                  information contained in this region using three
                  different settings. In a first approach, image
                  patches are sampled from this region and regression
                  is based on morphological features encoded by a
                  ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a
                  logistic regression from the determined mitotic
                  count, an approach which is easily traceable and
                  explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a
                  single network. We trained the pipeline on 951
                  slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a
                  separate set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All
                  approaches yield a high correlation to the WHO
                  grade. The logistic regression and the combined
                  approach had the best results in our experiments,
                  yielding correct predictions in $32$ and $33$ of all
                  cases, respectively, with the image-based approach
                  only predicting $25$ cases correctly. Spearman's
                  correlation was $0.7163$, $0.7926$ and $0.7900$
                  respectively. It might be counter-intuitive at first
                  that morphological features provided by the image
                  patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this
                  mirrors the criteria of the grading scheme, where
                  mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.},

                  and Eosin (H\&E) stained images is not widely
                  studied because microvessels are very complex and
                  heterogeneous.  In addition, their manual
                  identification is tedious, time-consuming and
                  subjective.  We investigate whether the vasculature
                  in H\&E can be robustly identified in whole slide
                  sections that would ultimately avoid the need for
                  IHC and manual annotations.  We propose an
                  artificial intelligence model based on Generative
                  Adversarial Networks (GAN) that, from an input H\&E
                  image, can generate a synthetic Erythroblast
                  Transformation specific related gene (ERG) stained
                  image, highlighting vessel structures. We also
                  trained a spatially constrained Convolutional Neural
                  Network (CNN) to identify single cells on ERG
                  stained whole slide images, and found good
                  concordance between detected cells in synthetic and
                  real ERG. This pipeline was evaluated on 2002 image
                  patches of size 2000x2000 pixels, sampled from 9
                  whole slide images.  We achieved the mean $R^2$ of
                  0.70$\pm$0.14 in our testing set.  This pipeline can
                  pave the way to study proximity of tumour cells to
                  blood vessels.  This approach has the potential to
                  reduce the use of IHC and tissues and enable large
                  quantitative studies.}

                  information for quantitative analysis. However,
                  cell/nuclei segmentation relies heavily on

                  labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive in
                  practical applications. Meanwhile, one might want to
                  fine-tune pretrained models on certain target
                  datasets. But it is always difficult to collect
                  enough target training images for proper

                  registration of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
                  hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained WSIs is usually
                  the first step in guiding IHC diagnostic
                  procedures. Still, many registration methods operate
                  poorly on WSIs. Reasons for this include the WSI
                  size, fluctuating image quality or elastic tissue
                  deformations. Multiple prior methods are further
                  specialised towards a specific image modality, such

                  a piece-wise affine transformation. We validated our
                  method on five scanner systems and 60 WSIs with
                  different stainings. Our results outperformed any
                  publicly available WSI registration method. The QT
                  code, WSI landmarks and tools used to create the

                  in improving diagnosis of MSI patients. Prior deep
                  learning models for MSI detection have relied on
                  neural networks pretrained on ImageNet dataset,
                  which does not contain any medical image. In this
                  study, we leverage recent advances in
                  self-supervised learning by training neural networks
                  on histology images from the TCGA dataset using MoCo
                  V2. We show that these networks consistently
                  outperform their counterparts pretrained using
                  ImageNet and obtain state-of-the-art results for MSI
                  detection with AUCs of 0.92 and 0.83 for CRC and
                  gastric tumors, respectively. These models
                  generalize well on an external CRC cohort (0.97 AUC
                  on PAIP) and improve transfer from one organ to
                  another. Finally we show that predictive image
                  regions exhibit meaningful histological patterns,
                  and that the use of MoCo features highlighted more
                  relevant patterns according to an expert
                  pathologist.}

  abstract =	 {Representation learning is a popular application of
                  deep learning where an object (e.g., an image) is
                  converted into a lower-dimensional representation
                  that still encodes relevant features of the original
                  object. In digital pathology, however, this is more
                  difficult because whole slide images (WSIs) are
                  tiled before processing because they are too large
                  to process at once. As a result, one WSI can be
                  represented by thousands of representations - one
                  for each tile. Common strategies to aggregate the
                  "tile-level representations" to a "slide-level
                  representation" rely on pooling operators or even
                  attention networks, which all find some weighted
                  average of the tile-level representations.  In this
                  work, we propose a novel approach to aggregate
                  tile-level representations into a single slide-level
                  representation. Our method is based on clustering
                  representations from individual tiles that originate
                  from a large pool of WSIs. Each cluster can be seen
                  as encoding a specific feature that might occur in a
                  tile. Then, the final slide-level representation is
                  a function of the proportional cluster membership of
                  all tiles from one WSI. We demonstrate that we can
                  represent WSIs in parsimonious representations and
                  that these aggregated slide-level representations
                  allow for both WSI classification and, reversely,
                  similar image search. }

                  (WSIs) digitization, the use of deep learning
                  methods for the analysis of histological images has
                  shown much potential. However, the sheer size of
                  WSIs is a real challenge, as they are often up to
                  100,000 pixels wide and high at the highest
                  resolution, and therefore cannot be processed
                  directly by any model. Moreover, as the manual
                  delineation of structures within WSIs is tedious,
                  histological datasets often only contain slide-level
                  labels, or a limited amount of delineated slides. In
                  this context, multiple-instance learning (MIL)
                  approaches have been proposed, considering WSIs as
                  bags of smaller images, designated as tiles or
                  patches. Among these methods, the attention-based
                  MIL aims at learning the importance of each tile for
                  the slide final classification while at the same
                  time performing a clustering of those tiles. In this
                  paper, we introduce the concept of mixed supervision
                  within this framework, by exploiting tile-level
                  labels in addition to slide-level labels to improve
                  the classification of slides. More precisely, we
                  show on the Camelyon16 dataset that even a small
                  proportion of slides with pixel-wise annotations can
                  improve their classification but also the
                  localization of tumorous regions. This improves the
                  consistency of the results between the tile and
                  slide levels and the interpretability of the
                  algorithm.}

                  reports can be a tedious and laborious
                  work. Pathologists need to combine and navigate
                  extremely large images with different scales and to
                  quantify different aspects for subtyping. In this
                  work, we propose an automatic diagnosis algorithm to
                  identify cell types and severity of H\&E slides, in
                  order to classify five major subtypes of glioma from
                  whole slide pathological images. The proposed method
                  is featured by a pyramid graph structure and an
                  attention-based multi-instance learning strategy. We
                  claim that our method not only improve the

                  information, but also help to identify high risk
                  patches. We summarized patches from multiple
                  resolutions into a graph structure. The nodes of the
                  pyramid graph are feature vectors extracted from
                  image patches, and these vectors are connected by
                  their spatial adjacency. We then fed the graph into
                  the proposed model with self-attention and graph
                  convolutions. Here, we used a multi-head
                  self-attention architecture, where same
                  self-attention blocks are stacked in parallel. As
                  proven in Transformer networks, multiple attention
                  maps herein capture comprehensive activation
                  patterns from different subspace
                  representation. Using the proposed method, the
                  results show a 70\% accuracy for glioma
                  subtyping. The multiresolution attention maps
                  generated from the proposed method could help locate
                  proliferations and necrosis in the whole pathologic
